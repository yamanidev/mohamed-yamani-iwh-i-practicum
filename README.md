## About
This is my solution to the Practicum of the course [Integrating With HubSpot I: Foundations](https://academy.hubspot.com/courses/integrating-with-hubspot-foundations).

[List view of Contact objects](https://app.hubspot.com/contacts/48827883/objects/0-1/views/all/list)

Note: Custom Objects are not available in the free tier, so I used the Contact object instead.

## Running locally
- Install the project's dependencies: `npm install`
- Copy the example environment variables file and fill it appropriately: `cp .example.env .env`
- Run the development server: `npm run dev`
